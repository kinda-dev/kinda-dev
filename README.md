### Ciao, I am Fabio, ðŸ‘‹

ex hospitality entrepreneur, world traveler from Italy based in California and I love software development.
Extremely curious by nature I've found in software developing what excites me: there is always something new to discover, something new to create. I love to learn and to know, as much as I can, in everything I do.

During my studies I discovered a big passion for Javascript, React and Redux, passion confirmed during my hands-on-code sessions. My natural non-biased critical thinking and get-it-done attitude completed with the human-centered experience acquired through my previous jobs makes me a perfect fit for the Tech Industry.

On a personal note I love wreching on motorcycles, I find it challenging and relaxing at the same time. My favorite mind-clearing activity is floating on a surfboard while waiting for the perfect wave surrounded by the stunning scenery of the Northern California coastline.

Whether it's building a motorcycle, cooking for my friends or coding I have a creative side that I have always enjoyed exploring, so Iâ€™m happy I am able to do that with software development.

I hope that my unique background will add a fresh perspective for tackling engineering problems, enhance the diversity within the tech community, and be why your work culture thrives.

Additional Skills: JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML5, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express.js, SQL, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, AWS, HTML, CSS, Webpack, jQuery, Git, Heroku, Node.js
