### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**kinda-dev/kinda-dev** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm  an ex hospitality worker that in 2018 followed his dreams and moved from Italy to the US to proudly become a Software Engineer.
During my studies I discovered a big passion for Javascript, React and Redux, passion confirmed during my hands-on-code sessions. My natural non-biased critical thinking and get-it-done attitude completed with the human-centered experience acquired through my previous jobs makes me a perfect fit for the Tech Industry.

I'm an extremely curious person and that's why software developing excites me: there is always something new to learn, something new to discover, something new to create.

My main project at the moment is a Netflix clone developed in the using  Ruby and Ruby on Rails, PSQL, AWS, Active Record and Ajax. The frontend is been handled by Html5 on a React.js framework, Redux for the state management and Scss to make it shiny, Webpack for bundling, NPM to manage packages.

On a personal note I love working on motorcycles, I find it challenging and relaxing at the same time. My favorite mind-clearing activity is floating on a surfboard while waiting for the perfect wave surrounded by the stunning scenery of the Northern California coastline.

Whether it's building a motorcycle, cooking for my friends or coding a little Javascript game I have a creative side that I have always enjoyed exploring, so Iâ€™m happy I am able to do that with software development.

My goal is to work one day on a technology that will make a positive impact on human life, technology for humans by humans.

Additional Skills: JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML5, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express.js, SQL, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, AWS, HTML, CSS, Webpack, jQuery, Git, Heroku, Node.js
